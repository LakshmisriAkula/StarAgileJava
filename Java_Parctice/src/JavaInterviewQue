Features of Java?: Compiled and Interpreted, Object Oriented, Simple and easy to understand, Platform Independent, Multi-threaded, Robust and secured, Distributed
What do you mean by Constructor?: Constructors are definition blocks in java which is used to initialize non-static variables.
									Constructor:
										1.	Used to create an object.
										2.	Used to initialize non-static variables.
What is Local Variable and Instance Variable?: 	Local variable: Variable which is declared within a method or block. Before utilize local variable it should be initialized.
												Instance Variable: An instance variable is declared inside a class but outside any method. It belongs to the object (instance) of the class.								
What is Class and Object?:	Class: Class is a blue print or a template to create an object
							Object: Object is instance of class. It is real time entity
What is inheritance with example?: Inheriting the members of parent class to child class except private members is called inheritance”.
						Example: class A{
	private int k=123;
	int i=100;
	static int j=200;
	void print(){
		System.out.println("Print method");
	}
	static void display(){
		System.out.println("Display method");
	}
}
class B extends A{
public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println(A.j);
		A.display();
		System.out.println(B.j);	//possible
		B.display();			//possible
		A a1 = new A();
		System.out.println(a1.i);
		a1.print();
		B b1 = new B();
		System.out.println(b1.i);
		b1.print();
						//System.out.println(a1.k);
		//System.out.println(b1.k);
	}
}

•	What is encapsulation with example?: Encapsulation is the packing of data and function into a single component and hiding the internal implementation
It is a achieved by hiding the data by making the variables private and showing the functionality through getter and setter methods.
By providing only setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
Example
class Encapsulation{
	private int i;
	private String str;
	
	void set(int a, String stmt){		//setter method
		i=a;
		str=stmt;
	}
	int get_i(){			//getter method
		return i;
	}
	String get_str(){		//getter method
		return str;
	}
}
public class Demo1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Encapsulation e = new Encapsulation();
		e.set(11,"Java");
		System.out.println("The value of i is "+e.get_i());
		System.out.println("The value of str is "+e.get_str());
	}
}
